# ❤️ ARISE.ai: Transforming Heart Failure Risk Prediction  

ARISE.ai is an **advanced AI-driven healthcare solution** designed to tackle the **global burden of heart failure readmissions**. By leveraging **cutting-edge AI models**, our system assists clinicians in **identifying high-risk patients early**, reducing complications, and **optimizing patient care** for **better health outcomes and cost savings**.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Statement  
Heart failure readmission is a **major healthcare crisis**, with over **20-25% of heart failure patients** being readmitted within **30 days**. This leads to:

🔴 **Increased mortality rates** due to delayed interventions  
🔴 **Higher healthcare costs**, burdening both patients and hospitals  
🔴 **Limited hospital resources**, reducing overall care efficiency  

The inability to accurately **predict readmission risk** means hospitals struggle with **reactive care** rather than **preventive treatment**, leading to **avoidable complications** and **strained medical infrastructure**.

### 🔎 Need for a Solution  
🔹 **Early identification of high-risk patients** allows hospitals to intervene proactively  
🔹 **Predictive AI models** help reduce hospital stays and unnecessary readmissions  
🔹 **Resource-limited settings need interpretable AI tools** for better clinical decision-making  
🔹 **Accurate, actionable risk scores** ensure **personalized patient management**  

ARISE.ai bridges this gap by providing **clinicians with an intelligent, evidence-driven solution**, enabling them to **focus resources where they matter most**.
