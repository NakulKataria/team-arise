# ARISE.ai 🫀📊  
**Accurate Readmission Insights with Scalable Explainability**  
*Predicting 30-day readmission risk in heart failure patients using AI—improving care, saving lives, and optimizing costs.*

## 🚨 The Problem: Why Readmission Prevention Matters  
Heart failure (HF) leads to frequent hospital readmissions, costing healthcare systems **$20 billion annually** in the U.S. alone. These readmissions signal **poor patient recovery and higher mortality risks**.  

## 🚀 Introducing ARISE.ai: AI-Powered Readmission Prevention  
ARISE.ai is an **AI-driven predictive platform** that assesses **30-day hospital readmission risk** for HF patients. It provides **clinically interpretable predictions**, helping care teams **intervene proactively** before complications arise.  

## 🧠 How ARISE.ai Works  
### 📊 Machine Learning Approach  
ARISE.ai employs a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on de-identified **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**.  

- **Model:** Random Forest  
- **Accuracy:** **93.27%**  
- **Training Data:** 50K+ patient records across demographics, medical history, lab results  
- **Output:** Risk classification (High/Low) with confidence score  

### 🔁 Workflow Overview  
1️⃣ **Patient Data Intake:** EHR integration via **API or CSV**  
2️⃣ **Preprocessing:** Feature engineering, normalization, missing-value imputation  
3️⃣ **Prediction:** AI model assesses readmission risk  
4️⃣ **Output:**  
   - **Risk label (High/Low)**  
   - **Confidence score**  
   - **Key contributing factors (Explainability via SHAP values)**  

## 📊 How ARISE.ai Handles Data Challenges  
### 🔬 Overcoming Imbalanced Data  
✔ **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling)** for balanced training  
✔ **Ensemble learning** to improve generalization  
✔ **Feature selection techniques** for boosting clinical relevance  

## 💼 Business Model  
ARISE.ai operates on a **B2B SaaS model**, targeting:  
🏥 **Hospitals & Health Systems** – Subscription-based licensing  
📈 **Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)** – Risk-sharing contracts  
🖥 **Health Tech Integrators** – White-label AI engine for predictive analytics
